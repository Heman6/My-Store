# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

# Ans: * = Expressions
#     'hello' = String
#     -87.8 = integer
#     - = value
#     / = value
#     + = value
#     6 = integer

# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?

# Ans: Variables are symbols that we can use to store data in a program. We can think of them as an empty box that we fill with some data or value. Strings are data, so we can use them to fill up a variable.

# 3.Describe three different data types

# Ans: a) Numeric - Integer, complex, float
#      b) Dictionary
#      c) Boolean
#      d) Set
#      e) Sequence Type - Strings, List, Tuple

# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

# Ans: An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some value. In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators.

# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

# Ans: Statement is just a line of code which is in String format. Where experession is combintion of values and operators (= & 10, String = like spam)

# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
#    bacon = 22
#    bacon + 1
# 

# Ans: 23

# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
#    'spam' + 'spamspam'
#    'spam' * 3
# 

# Ans: 'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'

# Ans: 'spam'*3 = 'spamspamspam'

# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

# Ans: eggs is string and also doesn't match with any operator in python. Whereas 100 is an integer and the chances to get sync is high

# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

# Ans:  int() , float() , and str( ) 

# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
#     'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
# 

# Ans: W = 'I have eaten 99 burritos'
# 
# The expression was causing and error because of the placement of the values, integers and string was wrong.
